Igor Raid Mechanics brings the following features:

[*][b]Minimum population for threats[/b], default 1. User-adjustable from 0 to 99. You decide when you are ready for raids! Just watch that wealth.
[*][b]Raid rewards![/b] Successfully take out a threat? Choose what events can happen! Good, bad, it's your choice. 
[*][b]Raid reinforcements![/b] Take a loss? Enemy reinforcements have arrived!

Q: Is this mod complete?
A: Yep. Unless we find some squashable bugs.

Q: Save game compatible?
A: Yes, add it any time, adjust settings on the fly!

Q: Does this change the frequency of raids?
A: No, I wanted this mod because I loved the damage increase and raid enhancements from Igor Invader, but disliked the raid frequency. Play with any storyteller at any difficulty you want, and this mod will do it's duty in the background.

Q: Do I need to subscribe to and have Igor Invader active?
A: Nope! All the code to make Igor work is handled by Vanilla Framework Expanded, just load us after the framework and you're good to go.
